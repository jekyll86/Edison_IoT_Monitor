# Edison_IoT_Monitor
This is a very basic project entirely made in javascript through the IDE "Intel XDK IoT edition". When you have finished, you will have a system to monitor environmental parameters (temperature, light and air quality), locally in the LCD and remotely through a web browser.

Me and my friends, Roberto and Luigi, realized this project as starting point for a future home automation system.

I want to thank Intel for this wonderful device and for the fantastic hackathon of Milan.
